If you have a servo motor and it's not working but you don't know whether it's broken or not, 
put your ear close to the servo motor and if you hear something like friction sounds coming from the servo motor, 
then the coupler is down, so your servo motor is malfunctioned. But the DC motor may be working correctly.
